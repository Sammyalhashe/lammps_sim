LAMMPS Review
Typical LAMMPS project structure
• each sim must be run in a new dir
• typical input files include:
– structure.dat
∗ size of system
∗ num atoms
∗ num atom types
∗ masses
∗ init positions/vel
– in.filename
∗ instructions of the tasks to perform
∗ parameters
∗ can also contain position of atoms
– pot.mod
∗ potential file
∗ contains info on which potential to use

Energy minimization
• for all the atoms, lammps will figure out where to move them so that their
energy is minimized
• at least a local minimum

Typical Potential File (pot.mod)
# BKS potential
# what type of potential we use
# last two numbers are cutoffs for the potentials
# distance-wise I believe
# if the distance is larger than these values, the potential is
# set to 0 to save computational time
# the buckingham pot contains multiple types of potentials
# inside: Coulomb and Buck
# we specify two cutoffs for each inner pot
